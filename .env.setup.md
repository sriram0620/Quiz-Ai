# Environment Setup for Quiz Application

## Quick Start (No Database Required)
The application now works without any environment setup! The session and quiz generation APIs will use mock data when environment variables are not configured.

## Full Setup (With Database)
If you want to use a real database and AI services:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
2. Add the following environment variables:

```
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# AI Service Configuration (choose one)
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key_here
# OR
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

3. Run the SQL script in `scripts/001_create_quiz_tables.sql` in your Supabase database

## Development Mode
- Without environment variables: Uses mock sessions and fallback questions
- With environment variables: Uses real database and AI services

## Starting the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on http://localhost:3000 (or the next available port).
